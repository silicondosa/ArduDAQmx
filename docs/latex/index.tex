{\ttfamily Ardu\+D\+A\+Qmx} is a portable and simple Arduino-\/esque C wrapper for for the National Instruments N\+I-\/\+D\+A\+Qmx A\+N\+SI C A\+PI.

\paragraph*{N\+O\+TE\+: This library is a work-\/in-\/progress and not ready for use yet.}

\subsection*{Introduction}

National Instruments provides a powerful and fully functional C developer A\+PI for their D\+AQ hardware called D\+A\+Qmx. Unfortunately, there isn\textquotesingle{}t a lot of easily accessible documentation or examples to get people up and running with it. Furthermore, the library is not beginner friendly with a large amount of configuration necessary before users record thir first data sample.

Ardu\+D\+A\+Qmx tries to bridge this gap by providing a simple interface/wrapper that makes using N\+I-\/\+D\+A\+Qmx easier by (mostly) emulating the function calls a programmer would make when using an Arduino while also exposing additional features such as timing and triggering support.

\subsection*{Usage}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This wrapper should work on all platforms supported by N\+I-\/\+D\+A\+Qmx. As of October 2018, N\+I-\/\+D\+A\+Qmx is supported by Windows and Linux operating systems.
\item Before using this library, please install the N\+I-\/\+D\+A\+Qmx software available on the \href{https://www.ni.com/dataacquisition/nidaqmx.htm/}{\tt National Instruments website.}
\item You need to get a copy of the N\+I-\/\+D\+A\+Qmx library files from the location where
\item they are stored as described on the \href{http://www.ni.com/product-documentation/54392/en/}{\tt NI website}.
\item Maybe move these files to a particular directory?
\item You may now use the Ardu\+D\+A\+Qmx wrapper in tandem with the N\+I-\/\+D\+A\+Qmx library.
